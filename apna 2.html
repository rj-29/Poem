        <p>Behold her, single in the field,</br>
            Yon solitary Highland Lass!</br>
            Reaping and singing by herself;</br>
            Stop here, or gently pass!</br>
            Alone she cuts and binds the grain,</br>
            And sings a melancholy strain;</br>
            O listen! for the Vale profound</br>
            Is overflowing with the sound.</br>
        </p>
            <p>
            No Nightingale did ever chaunt</br>
            More welcome notes to weary bands</br>
            Of travellers in some shady haunt,</br>
            Among Arabian sands:</br>
            A voice so thrilling ne'er was heard</br>
            In spring-time from the Cuckoo-bird,</br>
            Breaking the silence of the seas</br>
            Among the farthest Hebrides.</br>
        </p>
            <p>
            Will no one tell me what she sings?</br>
            Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow</br>
            For old, unhappy, far-off things,</br>
            And battles long ago:</br>
            Or is it some more humble lay,</br>
            Familiar matter of to-day?</br>
            Some natural sorrow, loss, or pain,</br>
            That has been, and may be again?</br>
        </p>
           <p>
            Whate'er the theme, the Maiden sang</br>
            As if her song could have no ending;</br>
            I saw her singing at her work,</br>
            And o'er the sickle bending;</br>
            I listened, motionless and still;</br>
            And, as I mounted up the hill,</br>
            The music in my heart I bore,</br>
            Long after it was heard no more.</br>
